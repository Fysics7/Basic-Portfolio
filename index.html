          a spaceship and fly around the galaxy and see all the planets, stars, and other celestial objects. At the same time, my father introduced me to a computer at an early age and I played my first “video-game.” From that point on, I was hooked.
          From playing video games, to reading fantasy and science fiction novels, I wanted to immerse myself int fantasy lands, strange planets, and futuristic settings in books and movies. At this point, you would think that I would either be in movies,
          working for NASA, be an Astronaut, or make video games. Well, I went into finance out of all disciplines. Now, I have made the decision to learn the tools necessary to finally allow my creative mind to be expressed and further my skills and
          knowledge of learning the craft of being a developer.</p>
